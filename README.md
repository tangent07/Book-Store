# Project Overview

This program contains both front-end and back-end code for a bookstore app with a simple graphical user interface (**GUI**)
built with [**Tkinter library**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html). While I personally might not choose Tkinter if I were to build a real-world app with modern UI,
Tkinter serves me well in terms of getting me familiar with how to connect to databases(**SQLite** in this case), manipulatie data, and 
reflect the changes on the front end with Python.

The program supports all 4 essentail CRUD functionalities and I also manage to package the program into a standalone executable file for production/distribution
using **py2app** library by following the tutorial [here](https://www.metachris.com/2015/11/create-standalone-mac-os-x-applications-with-python-and-py2app/).

For the standalone executable, please see the **app folder** and look for file named **frontend** inside folder **dist**.
